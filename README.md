# Mid-Career-Salary-Analysis-NWC-OR-and-WA
This project involves two parts: database creation (SQL) and targeted analysis (SQL, Python, R) to explore mid-career (10+ years of work experience) salary rankings in the Northwest Conference (NWC) as well as all colleges/universities in Oregon and Washington(WA).

Techniques/Approaches:
  (SQL): database creation, data manipulation/cleaning (text extraction, realtions, contraints, aggregations, joins), data prepartation/export, analysis \n
  (Python): webscraping for data collection, exploratory data analysis, data manipulation, model fitting - sklearn (Lasso Regression predictor)
  (R): 95% confidence interval creation 
  
Materials:
  (Final Project - Database.sql): SQL script used to create database and manipulate data ;
  (Final Project - Analysis.sql): SQL script to query answers for various anaysis questions, export CSV files ;
  (Mid-Career Salary Analysis.ipynb): Python code used for webscraping/data collection, EDA, and anaysis including fitting a Lasso Regression predictor for target variable ;
